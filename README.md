Classes I wrote, e.g. Trie, that are useful for leetcode problems that aren't already implemented in Python's ``collections`` module

The end of this code is to be used in leetcode submissions, which requires copy and pasting the needed classes into
individual leetcode submissions

In order to serve that purpose well the code has to be
1. correct
1. small, to not distract from the more important parts of the submission

and ideally is also
1. fast 

This repo also serves another purpose along the way namely
1. practice writing unit tests
